						  	<h3><a href="#">Relation Problem</a></h3>
						  	<p>1. Reflective listening.</p>
							  <p>“Reflective listening is a highly beneficial exercise where the couple take turns being active listeners,” says Laura Louis, a licensed psychologist at Atlanta Couple Therapy.</p>

								<p> “I” phrases instead of “you” statements. For example, say “I feel hurt when you do X” instead of “You’re wrong for doing X.”</p>
								
								<p>“When couples take turns being active listeners, it boosts healthy communication skills as well as conflict resolution skills for the couple,” Louis says..</p>
						    
							<p>2. Emotionally focused therapy</p>
							  <p>Many therapists use a method called emotionally focused therapy (EFT).</p>

								<p> The goal is for couples “to identify maladaptive patterns within the relationship that are interfering with secure bonds and attachments,” says Ansley Campbell, a clinical director at The Summit Wellness Group.</p>
								
								<p>People “learn and utilize techniques to heal or create safe and secure attachments within the relationship,” she explains.</p>

								<p>3. Narrative therapy</p>
								<p>The practice of narrative therapy revolves around people describing their problems in narrative form and rewriting their stories. This can help them see that no single story can possibly encapsulate the totality of their experience.</p>

						  	<h3><a href="#">Couples Counseling</a></h3>
						  	<p>Types of Counselling</p>
								<p>Counselling has many types. The key to successful counselling is to know which type you are comfortable with:</p>
  
								  <p>Cognitive therapy – This therapy is based the theory that your actions and feelings are often due to the way you think. This form of therapy enables psychiatrists to help you change the way you are thinking in order to feel or behave better.</p>
								  
								  <p>Behavior therapy – This kind of therapy focuses on the modification of unwanted as well as unhealthy behaviors. Healthy habits and behavior are enforced through the use of rewards..</p>
								  <p>Group therapy – An experienced personnel leads a group therapy session. It is a confidential environment where people with the same mental health issues get to share their feelings. The members support one another when they need it.</p>

						  	<h3><a href="#">Depression Treatment</a></h3>
						  	<p>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).</p>
							  <p>According to guidelines issued by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), cognitive behavioural therapy is among the recommended therapies for treating depression. This therapy is based on the premise that the way we behave and think affects the way we feel. People with depression tend to have self-defeating thoughts that can lead to negative behaviour. CBT aims to help them identify and address these negative thoughts.</p>
							  <p>Counselling for Depression (CfD)</p>
							  <p>CfD is a model of psychological therapy recommended by NICE for the treatment of depression and approved for delivery within the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies Programme (IAPT). Counselling for Depression is one of the therapies recommended in addition to CBT.</p>

						  	<h3><a href="#">Family Problem</a></h3>
						  	<p><h5>1
								Wait until you're not angry to discuss this problem.</h5> Family problems can be very painful, especially around family-centered times, like holidays. If your family members are arguing, waiting until everyone is calm can help keep the argument from escalating into a full-blown feud.
								Don't discuss the family problem when you're still feeling upset or emotional. If you wait even a single night, the intensity of the emotion is likely to subside somewhat, even if you're still unhappy.
								Waiting allows you to approach the issue logically, rather than emotionally. If you take a step back and give yourself some time to think before dealing with the issue, you won’t deal with it so reactively.
								Approaching someone when you are angry will heighten the intensity around an already tough situation. There's no reason you can't wait to make your point tomorrow, so control your instant impulse..</p>

						  <div class="tab-pane container p-0 fade" id="services-5">
						  	<div class="img" style="background-image: url(images/services-5.jpg);"></div>
						  	<h3><a href="#">Personal Problem</a></h3>
						  	<p><h5>
								1. First, ask yourself: is there really a problem here?</h5>Often we create problems in our own heads – as I mentioned a bit about a few days ago in Simplify Your Life – that aren’t really out there in reality. So relax a bit. And think about if this is really a big problem.
								Is it something that will matter in 5 years? Or even in 5 weeks?

								Life becomes so less stressful when you stop making mountain out of molehills (or just out of thin air). </p>
							  
							  <p><h5>2. Accept it.</h5>When you accept that the problem already exists and stop resisting then you also stop putting more energy into the problem and “feeding it”.

								Now it just exists (well, more or less, you might still feel a bit down about it).
								
								You can use the energy you previously fed the problem with – the energy that probably made the problem look bigger than it was – to find creative solutions to the challenge. </p>
							  <p><h5>3. Ask for help.</h5> </p>
							  <p><h5></h5>You can ask people for advice on what to do and what they did in similar situations. 
								But you can also ask for more practical help. You don’t have to solve every problem on your own and sometimes it feels better to have someone by your side, even if it is just for emotional support.

								If you just ask you may find that people will often be willing to help you out.</p>
							  <p><h5>4. Use 80 percent of your time to find solutions.</h5>And only 20 percent to complain, worry and whine.

								It might not always be easy but focusing your energy, time and thoughts in this way is much more beneficial for you and others than doing the opposite. </p>
						  </div>
						  <div class="tab-pane container p-0 fade" id="services-6">
						  	<div class="img" style="background-image: url(images/services-6.jpg);"></div>
						  	<h3><a href="#">Business Problem</a></h3>
						  	<p><h5>1. Be ever-curious</h5>As any parent knows, four-year-olds are unceasing askers. Think of the never-ending “whys” that make little children so delightful—and relentless. For the very young, everything is new and wildly uncertain. But they’re on a mission of discovery, and they’re determined to figure things out. And they’re good at it! That high-energy inquisitiveness is why we have high shelves and childproof bottles.

								When you face radical uncertainty, remember your four-year-old or channel the four-year-old within you. Relentlessly ask, “Why is this so?” Unfortunately, somewhere between preschool and the boardroom, we tend to stop asking. Our brains make sense of massive numbers of data points by imposing patterns that have worked for us and other humans in the past. That’s why a simple technique, worth employing at the beginning of problem solving, is simply to pause and ask why conditions or assumptions are so until you arrive at the root of the problem</p>
							  <p><h5>2. Tolerate ambiguity—and stay humble!</h5>When we think of problem solvers, many of us tend to picture a poised and brilliant engineer. We may imagine a mastermind who knows what she’s doing and approaches a problem with purpose. The reality, though, is that most good problem solving has a lot of trial and error; it’s more like the apparent randomness of rugby than the precision of linear programming. We form hypotheses, porpoise into the data, and then surface and refine (or throw out) our initial guess at the answer. This above all requires an embrace of imperfection and a tolerance for ambiguity—and a gambler’s sense of probabilities.</p>
							  <p><h5>3. Take a dragonfly-eye view</h5>Dragonfly-eye perception is common to great problem solvers. Dragonflies have large, compound eyes, with thousands of lenses and photoreceptors sensitive to different wavelengths of light. Although we don’t know exactly how their insect brains process all this visual information, by analogy they see multiple perspectives not available to humans. The idea of a dragonfly eye taking in 360 degrees of perception6 is an attribute of “superforecasters”—people, often without domain expertise, who are the best at forecasting events.

								Think of this as widening the aperture on a problem or viewing it through multiple lenses. The object is to see beyond the familiar tropes into which our pattern-recognizing brains want to assemble perceptions. By widening the aperture, we can identify threats or opportunities beyond the periphery of vision.</p>
							  <p><h5>4. Pursue occurrent behavior</h5>Occurrent behavior is what actually happens in a time and place, not what was potential or predicted behavior. Complex problems don’t give up their secrets easily. But that shouldn’t deter problem solvers from exploring whether evidence on the facets of a solution can be observed, or running experiments to test hypotheses. You can think of this approach as creating data rather than just looking for what has been collected already. It’s critical for new market entry—or new market creation. It also comes in handy should you find that crunching old data is leading to stale solutions.

								Most of the problem-solving teams we are involved with have twin dilemmas of uncertainty and complexity, at times combined as truly “wicked problems.”7 For companies ambitious to win in the great unknown in an emerging segment—such as electric cars or autonomous vehicles, where the market isn’t fully established—good problem solving typically involves designing experiments to reduce key uncertainties, not just relying on existing data. Each move (such as buying IP or acquiring a component supplier) and each experiment (including on-road closed tests) not only provides additional information to make decisions but also builds capabilities and assets that support further steps. Over time, their experiments, including alliances and acquisitions, come to resemble staircases that lead to either the goal or to abandonment of the goal. Problem-solving organizations can “bootstrap” themselves into highly uncertain new spaces, building information, foundational assets, and confidence as they take steps forward..</p>
